# Connection Node Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The connection nodes (ports) on notes were not visible when hovering over notes, making it impossible for users to create connections between notes.

### Root Cause

The `ConnectionNode` component's visibility logic (`isActive` calculation at line 41) only considered:
- Local hover state on the connection node itself
- Connection mode active state
- Highlight state
- Dragging state

**The connection nodes did not know when their parent Note component was hovered**, so they remained invisible (3px radius with 0.3 opacity) until directly hovered - which was impossible because they were too small to discover.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `ConnectionNode.jsx` (frontend/src/components/ConnectionNode.jsx)

**Added new props** to receive parent state:
```javascript
isParentHovered = false,
isParentSelected = false
```

**Updated visibility logic** (line 43):
```javascript
const isActive = isHovered || isConnectionMode || isHighlighted || isDragging || isParentHovered || isParentSelected
```

Now connection nodes become visible when:
- The parent note is hovered ✅
- The parent note is selected ✅
- Connection mode is active
- The node itself is hovered
- Any other highlight/drag state

### 2. Updated `Note.jsx` (frontend/src/components/Note.jsx)

**Passed parent state to ConnectionNode components** (lines 1037-1090):

Added `isParentHovered` and `isParentSelected` props to all 4 ConnectionNode instances (top, right, bottom, left):

```javascript
<ConnectionNode
  noteId={note.id}
  position="top"
  noteWidth={noteSize.width}
  noteHeight={noteSize.height}
  onStartConnection={onStartConnection}
  onCompleteConnection={onCompleteConnection}
  onDragMove={onConnectionDragMove}
  isConnectionMode={connectionMode?.fromNoteId === note.id}
  isHighlighted={connectionMode && connectionMode.fromNoteId !== note.id}
  isParentHovered={isHovered}  // ← NEW
  isParentSelected={isSelected}  // ← NEW
/>
```

## Result

✅ **Connection nodes are now visible** when hovering over or selecting a note
✅ Users can see the 4 connection ports (top, right, bottom, left) as purple circles
✅ Connection functionality is now discoverable and usable
✅ The fix is minimal and non-breaking - only adds new optional props

## Testing Performed

1. Launched backend and frontend servers
2. Opened app in Chrome DevTools
3. Hovered over notes - connection nodes now appear as expected
4. Verified all 4 connection ports (top, right, bottom, left) are visible on hover
5. Confirmed visual styling is appropriate (purple circles with glow effect)

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/mac_orion/canvas_notes/frontend/src/components/ConnectionNode.jsx`
   - Added `isParentHovered` and `isParentSelected` props
   - Updated `isActive` calculation

2. `/Users/mac_orion/canvas_notes/frontend/src/components/Note.jsx`
   - Passed parent hover/select state to all 4 ConnectionNode components

## No Breaking Changes

The fix is backwards compatible:
- New props have default values (`false`)
- Existing functionality remains unchanged
- Only enhances visibility behavior
